# vimrc

My personal vim setup.
Some of the keybinds only work on MacOS but I'll update them when I have time.

This is primarily for my own personal use when I'm active on a new machine but you are welcome to steal it.

# Installation
Preparation (May be omitted):
```sh
rm -rf ~/.git ~/README.md ~/.vim ~/.vimrc
```

Install Settings:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Pandoks/vimrc.git
mv vimrc/.* ~
rm -rf vimrc ~/.git ~/README.md
```
